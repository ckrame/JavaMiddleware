 * Usage example:
 * </p>
 * <code>
 * <p>ThreadPool myThreadPool = new ThreadPool (3, 5000);<br />
 * myThreadPool.executeOrAbort(runnable1); // essential tasks, which must be started immediately or aborted<br />
 * myThreadPool.execute(runnable2); ...    // common tasks, which will be started as soon as possible <br />
 * myThreadPool.execute(runnableN);<br />
 * myThreadPool.shutdown();</p>
