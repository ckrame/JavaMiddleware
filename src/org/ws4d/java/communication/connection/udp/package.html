<p>UDP Client and Server implementation.</p>
<p>The UDP server's (<code>UDPServer</code>)open and close methods open/close a datagram socket (<code>DatagramSocket</code> interface. Implementing classes should be platform specific) for a given address and port, which will start a UDP Listener.
 This UDP listener (<code>UDPListener</code>) therefore listens to this given address and port for incoming datagram packets,
which it then passes on the the UDP Datagram Handler (<code>UDPDatagramHandler</code>) which will open each datagram packet in a separate thread. 
A datagram packet is modelised by the <code>Datagram</code> class (containing information about the address, the port, the data socket from which it stems, and the content length.). The UDP Client )<code>UDPClient</code> uses its 
given address and port  to create a datagram socket, to in turn be able to send messages. </p>
