	 * Because the JMEDS framework handles attachments asynchronously, it is possible (and will most likely occur frequently) for an attachement's raw data to still be being transmitted over the network while a caller's business logic (e.g. the {@link Operation#invoke(ParameterValue)} method) gets called providing access to the attachment by means of its {@link ParameterValue#get(String)}. Using methods other than {@link #getContentId()} or {@link #isAvailable()} on this attachment would block the caller until the entire attachment is read out. Thus, this method allows to check whether further examination of this attachment would block it or not.

Furthermore, some environments or some types of attachments (see e.g. InputStreamAttachment or FileAttachment) may not support representing the attachment's raw data as a byte array. In these cases, a call to this method will cause an {@link AttachmentException} to get thrown (see {@link #getType()}.
