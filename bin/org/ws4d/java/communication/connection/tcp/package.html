<p>Platform independent server socket/connection and TCP connection framework.</p>
<p>Defines two interfaces <code>Socket</code> and <code>ServerSocket</code> which respectively
define a platform independent server socket and connection (see implementing classes for platform specific implementation).</p>
<p>Implements a TCP connection framework, that is, a TCP client (<code>TCPClient</code>), a TCP server, which can open and close a server
socket for a given address and port. The socket implementation is stored in <code>TCPConnection</code>, to ensure that the socket can be correctly closed. A TCP Listener is further
implemented <code>TCPListener</code>, which will listen for incoming connections. Each  received connection will then be handled in a separate thread
by implementations of the interface <code>TCPConnectionHandler</code>.</p>
